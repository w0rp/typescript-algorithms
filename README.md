# TypeScript Algorithms

This repository hosts some TypeScript algorithms which are licensed other the
[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), and therefore released into the public
domain. The intention of this repository is to share important algorithms for
writing TypeScript code such that they can be copy and pasted into any codebase
and used freely by anyone for any reason.

The NPM package has no dependences other than `devDependences`, and the code is
designed to work in any
[ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) JavaScript
environment with a recent stable TypeScript compiler.

## Algorithms

Here is a comprehensive list of every algorithm demonstrated in this repository,
with links to behaviour tests for each algorithm.

* [`pick(obj, ...keys)`](src/algorithm/pick.spec.ts) - Pick a subset of keys
  from an object.
